# 7. Create a new project or update an existing one

When creating a new application, it is assumed that you already have the base classes and infrastructure \(navigation service, database and REST APIs\) that you will use when creating the project skeleton:

**Step 1.** Create an empty application and create infrastructure folders and classes in it.

**Step 2.** Add subfolders for each section for ViewModels, Pages. Add empty classes of ViewModels and Pages.

**Step 3.** Add transitions between screens and their states based on the transition map.

**Step 4.** Add empty DataServices and DataObjects based on the table of screens. 

**Step 5.** Add and implement all styles.

**Step 6.** Implement DataServices, possibly as a first step and with Mock-data (test data from local JSON / CSV-files).

**Step 7.** Implement stubs for background functionality.

That's it, the skeleton is ready! This preparatory work will take the team a day or two, but it will allow you to get the fully functional skeleton of the project, already corresponding to the documentation, your architecture, and your navigation model. Next, it remains to divide the work into modules, sections and screens, and in each particular case, keep in mind only that information which is needed at the moment \(several paragraphs of text, a screenshot, names from the code, etc.\). Recall that this scenario is effective only if you already have a Base Infrastructure.

When refactoring the project, you can just prepare the documentation and do easy cosmetic renaming. This will give the team uniform artifacts and ensure the continuity of the knowledge from one specialist to another.
